Budget Tracker
The Budget Tracker is a simple web app that I built using HTML, CSS (SASS), and JavaScript that allows users to track their income and expenses. It features an intuitive user friendly interface where you can easily add income or expense transactions, specifying the description, amount, and date. The app calculates and displays the total budget, income, and expenses, updating in real-time as transactions are added. It also provides a list of all recorded transactions, with an option to delete them. The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The application is built using object-oriented programming principles with a budget class that manages the transactions and performs the necessary calculations. Whether you're managing personal finances or just tracking daily expenses, the Budget Tracker provides a clean and functional way to keep an eye on your financial status.
To get started, simply enter the transaction details and submit the form. Your budget summary will automatically update with the latest total. If you need to remove a transaction, just click the "Delete" button next to it. Some future changes for my tracker  could include saving transactions to local storage, adding more detailed validation, and implementing features like a graph.
